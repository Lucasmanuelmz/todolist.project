# TODOLIST PROJECT

The first phase of the to-do list project, featuring data storage functionality in localStorage, has been completed. Thproject is part of my educational journey within
The Odin Project's curriculum. While the initial phase is finished, I still plan to make adjustments to ensure the project behaves as expected.
